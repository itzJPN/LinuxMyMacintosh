LinuxMyMacintosh easily allows you to set up lima Linux containers on your Mac.

LinuxMyMacintosh has these flags allowing you to control your containers:
  -install (installs lima and LinuxMyMacintosh)
  -erase (deletes the installation of lima and LinuxMyMacintosh)

If you run LinuxMyMacintosh without these flags you will see a screen that tells you the current flags.

To run LinuxMyMacintosh, place the SH script in your desktop or other location, then run `chmod +x path/to/LinuxMyMac.sh`
